##Bet-Tracker
Welcome to Bet Tracker! This is the first front-end 'no server' app I've ever built.
It uses FireBase as a backend and was built using Javascript and Angular.
I built this for a project at DevMountain in Provo during my Web-Development Course.

#How-To
1. The landing page lists all of my friends I regularly make bets with.
-You are able to add people by first and last name, phone number, and some sort of payment method user-name.
2. Once you click on a 'better', you will be taken to the current bets page. This page lists
all of the current bets you have with that person. You can delete those bets or satisfy them.
3. Once a bet is satisfied, it will be moved into the 'satisfied-bets' page. This page shows the bets
you have satisfied with that person. It also keeps track of your wins and losses.

#Progress
I have left this page pretty raw. There are plenty of changes and fixes and improvements I have wanted to make as
I better my skills. I thought it would be fun to leave it just how it was after I finished it after only 4 weeks of learning how to code.
